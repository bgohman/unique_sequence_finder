**Unique Sequence Finder**

This project is my solution to this challenge: https://gist.github.com/pedromartinez/7788650.

**Basic usage:**

From the project folder in the command line, run the following:

    $ ruby words_test.rb

You will be prompted to choose one of the available dictionaries.  For testing purposes, chose one of the small dictionaries.  It takes over 3 minutes to process the final dictionary.
